Once upon a time, there was a race held between a rabbit and a tortoise . 
Everyone in the jungle thought that rabbit would be the winner for sure.
When the race began the rabbit ran very fast due to which it got tired and sat down to take some rest. On the other hand the tortoise was moving with the same 
speed from the very begining of the race.

Then the tortoise wins the race.
And gives us the proverb "slow and steady wins the race."
